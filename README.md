# My_project

<h1>Subject</h1>

<p>In a first time, it's important to understand I have choose the subject of PFH for this project
I was the manager of the team which have organized the Business Forum and the Internation Forum, 2 big events for the school.
And I have noted that we did't have adapted tools to execute our tasks compared to the tools for the technical project.
One of problem is that we have needed to communicate withe a lot of people or member of company. So, we lost time to research a number on our phone because of the shuffle of numbers (friend, familiy...) That's why I have decided to create a contact repository </p>.

<h1>Structure</h1>

  <p>Start the project
  To start the project, we need to use the class "Launcher" in the package "Welcome". Thanks to this activity, we have access to an interface of connection </p>
  
      Problem(s) encountered : I didn't have specific problem for this activity but it's very import to modify the Android Manisfest to                                    have a functional application
      Solution(s) :             /

  <p>Connexion</p>
  
   Now you arrive on an interface for connect you. You have two possibilities : Create an account or sign in.
   
      Problem(s) encountered : 
      
                              To sign in, we need to have all the contact thanks to a LiveData but I don't understand how to have access atthis list and its content 
                              
                              I have tried to create this interface in mvvm thanks to a tutorel. But a problem appears if I put the files in a package and an other because the binding
                              
      YOU CAN HAVE ACCESS AT THESE DOCUMENTS IN THE PROJECT -> DOCUMENTS OUTSIDE PACKAGAGE
      
      Solution(s) :           We give access if we have an email and a password not empty 
                              We have not used the mvvm for this part
</p>.
